==================

An HTML email blaster using Access/Outlook and any email system you like.  I like SendGrid, but who cares?

Because I didn't like any of the commercial email systems, I developed my own using Access for a database of 
HTML emails that I could use code to merge into my emails.

Yeah, yeah, I know, MicroSquish, but it's readily commercially available, easy to use and does a nice job.
I especially like Office now that it's a subscription model, and available fairly cheaply.  Especially if you
tell them you're a student...

More to come on the description; this is a work in progress.
